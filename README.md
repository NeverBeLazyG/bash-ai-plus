Leveraging the newest OpenAI's capabilities (standard model used: gpt-4o-mini, can be changed in config file), it allows you to ask questions and perform terminal-based tasks using natural language (English, German etc.). It provides answers and command suggestions based on your input and allows you to execute or edit the suggested commands if desired.

Bash AI is not only powerful out of the box, but also expandable!\
With its plugin architecture, you can easily add your own tools, thereby empowering Bash AI to accomplish even more, and extending its functionality beyond its original capabilities.

## Features

- **100% Shell Script**\
	No need to install anything. Just run it!
	
- **Plugins!**\
	Extend Bash AI's functionality by adding plugins known as "tools".

- **Natural Language Interface**\
	Communicate with the terminal using everyday language.
	
- **Question Answering**\
	Get answers to all your terminal questions by ending your request with a question mark.

## Setup

1. To setup Bash AI quickly, you can run the following command:

```bash
curl -sS https://github.com/NeverBeLazyG/bash-ai-plus/main/install.sh | bash
```

Be sure to have curl and jq installed before running.
```bash
sudo apt install jq
```
> [!WARNING]
> Never run unknown scripts without reviewing them for safety. Read the install script [here](https://github.com/NeverBeLazyG/bash-ai-plus/main/install.sh).

2. Run `baip` to start Bash AI Plus.

<details>
<summary><b>Manual Setup</b></summary>

1. Clone or download the repository:

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/NeverBeLazyG/bash-ai-plus
	```
2. Make the script executable:

	```bash
	chmod +x baip.sh
	```

3. Execute Bash AI:

	```bash
	./baip.sh
	```

*  _(Optional)_ For convenience, you can create a shortcut to the `baip.sh` script. There are two ways to do this:

	* Create a symbolic link in `/usr/local/bin`. This will allow you to run the script from anywhere, without having to type the full path. Replace `path/to/baip.sh` with the actual path to the `baip.sh` script:

		```bash
		ln -s path/to/baip.sh /usr/local/bin/baip
		```

	* Alternatively, you can create an alias for the `baip.sh` script in your `.bashrc` file. This will also allow you to execute the script using the `baip` command, reducing the need for typing the full path to the script each time. Replace `path/to/baip.sh` with the actual path to the `baip.sh` script:

		```conf
		alias baip='path/to/baip.sh'
		```

</details>

## Configuration

On the first run, a configuration file named `baip.cfg` will be created in your `~/.config` directory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always remove `baip.cfg` before updating Bash AI to avoid compatibility issues.

You must provide a [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) in the `key=` field of this file. The [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) can be obtained from your [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

> [!CAUTION]
> Keeping the key in a plain text file is dangerous, and it is your responsibility to keep it secure.

You can also change the [GPT model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) (the default model is set to gpt-4o-mini), [temperature](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-temperature) and many other things in this file.

## Usage

Bash AI Plus operates in two modes: Interactive Mode and Command Mode.

To enter Interactive Mode, you simply run `baip` without any request. This allows you to continuously interact with Bash AI without needing to re-run the command.

In Command Mode, you run `baip` followed by your request, like so: `baip your request here`

Example usage:

```
baip create a new directory with a name of your choice, then create a text file inside it
```

You can also ask questions  by ending your request with a question mark:
```
baip what is the current time?
```

## Plugins and tools

Plugins are OpenAI tools that expand Bash AI's functionality, but they are not included in the default Bash AI setup.\
All tools should be placed in your `~/.baip_tools` directory.\
You can see which tools are currently installed by running `baip`, and Bash AI will list them for you.

Tools are nothing more than a shell script with a `init` and `execute` function.\
You can find examples and available tools in the [tools folder](https://github.com/Hezkore/bash-ai/tree/main/tools).\
Feel free to move them to your `~/.baip_tools` directory to enable them!

##  History function like in a CLI
The history function is what it makes it different to the Original script by Hezkore/bash-ai.

## Known Issues

- In Command Mode, avoid using single quotes in your requests.\
	For instance, the command `baip what's the current time?` will not work. However, both `baip "what's the current time?"` and `baip what is the current time?` will execute successfully.\
	Please note that this issue is specific to the terminal, and does not occur in Interactive Mode.
